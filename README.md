* Snapshot
  * on GNU/Linux, MacOS or *BSD clone this repository and use the provided `build-package` script like
     * first step:
         * `build-package pull` to download all required apks for Full, microG and F-Droid package
     * second step:
         * `build-package full` to create the full package
         * `build-package microg` to create the microG only package
         * `build-package fdroid` to create the F-Droid only package
         * `build-package patcher` to create the on-device framework-patcher package
         * `build-package uninstaller` to create the uninstaller package
         * `build-package setupwizard` to create the Setup Wizard package
         * `build-package all` to create all packages at once
     * third step:
         * `build-package u-microg` to update microG
         * `build-package u-fdroid` to update F-Droid
         * `build-package u-apps` to update (most) applications
         * `build-package u-swipe` to update swipe libraries
         * `build-package u-gsync` to update Google Sync Adapters
         * `build-package pull` to update/re-download everything

for apks downloaded from F-Droid or microG repository or from APK Mirror, `build-package` checks the SHA256 hash.

The `build-package` script additionally supports the following parameters:

* `check` check if all files were properly downloaded
* `clean` remove any untracked files from the repo (e. g. from `build-package pull`)
* `dalvik [.jar]` prepare a jar file for use with DalvikVM
* `ver [version] [date]` change project version
* `bump` increment Magisk module version by 1

the `build-package` script does not download/update the following applications:

* Play Store (reason: re-signed and modified to support (in-)app-purchases with microG GmsCore)

those are still included in the repo itself. Also `build-package` now looks if the configuration files

* `.nanomod-setup`
* `.nanomod-apps`
* `.nanomod-overlay`

exist in the `data` directory of the repository, if so, those files are used when creating packages instead of the default ones.

See the documentation below for more information on those files and what they do.

## Supported Android Versions

## Details

### NanoMod

This lists features unique to NanoMod.

#### nanomod-overlay

The `nanomod-overlay` script handles the following features

* pseudo-debloat (Magisk-only)
  * show the list of pseudo-debloated apps
  * add or remove apps from the list of pseudo-debloated apps
* add system properties (Magisk-only)
* grant signature spoofing permission to microG and Play Store if required
  * both in Magisk and System Mode
* issue `nanomod-overlay --help` for the full list of options

Full details on the nanomod-overlay Script [> Details](doc/NanoModOverlay.md)
Full details on the pseudo-debloat feature [> Details](doc/PseudoDebloat.md)

#### init scripts

The following init scripts are bundled with NanoMod

* external_sd
  * symlink SD Card mount point to `/external_sd`
  * SD Card needs to be inserted upon boot
* fstrim
  * trim file systems (may increase speed)
* logscleaner
  * clean up log files
* sqlite

When in Magisk Mode the init scripts create their log files in

  `/magisk/NanoMod/.logs/${script}.log.${date}`

When installed to /system your ROM needs to support running scripts in

  `/system/etc/init.d`

or you can use **Kernel Adiutor's** init.d emulation.

     * it conflicts with microG's location backend

### F-Droid and Applications

F-Droid [> Website](http://www.fdroid.org) is an app store for Open Source applications.

NanoMod includes both F-Droid and it's Privileged Extension [> F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=f-droid&fdid=org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged), so you don't need to enable `Unknown Sources`.

Additionally NanoMod includes a variety of applications, check full details [> GitHub](doc/Applications.md)

### The Legend of Zelda ringtones and sounds

NanoMod includes **The Legend of Zelda** [> Nintendo](http://www.zelda.com/) ringtones and sounds, because it's dangerous to root alone.

Full [> Details](doc/ZeldaSounds.md)

## Installation

### Alter Installation

NanoMod supports altering the installation settings to a certain degree.

Full [> Details](doc/AlterInstallation.md) on altering installation manually, or use the Setup Wizard (if you've got an arm/arm64 device).

### Installation Process

#### NanoMod

* Use Setup Wizard to create configuration files (if you've got an arm/arm64 device), or create manually (see above)
* Download pre-built zip or create one from this repository
* perform full wipe (/system, /data, /cache, Dalvik/ART cache)
  * recommended, but not required
* install desired ROM
  * make sure it does **not** include GApps if you want to use microG
  * either pre-patched with signature spoofing support or **deoxeded** so you can patch yourself (instructions follow)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install **Magisk**
  * recommended, but not required
  * if **Magisk** is installed, NanoMod will be installed as Magisk-Module, else it will install into `/system` directly
* install **NanoMod**
* reboot into ROM

#### microG

##### Signature Spoofing Support

For **microG** to work, your ROM needs to have signature spoofing enabled (or a **deodexed** ROM to patch yourself).

If your ROM does **not** have signature spoofing support, you can manually patch it either
  * flashing the on-device Patcher zip
     * it also installs an addon.d script that auto re-patches the ROM upon update
  * running the `framework-patcher` script
     * use from your PC or laptop while your device is in TWRP. This shell script for GNU Bash (and compatible shells) works on unixoid operating systems like GNU/Linux, BSD or MacOS. It automizes the process of downloading Haystack [> GitHub](https://github.com/Lanchon/haystack), pulling files from phone, patching and installing the modified `services.jar` on the device.

Both patchers support installing the patched `services.jar` into the following locations:
  * NanoMod Magisk Module
  * NanoMod-microG Magisk Module
  * directly into `/system`

So you can use them regardless whether you're using NanoMod or not.

##### microG Setup

Once your ROM supports signature spoofing, you need to setup microG like this
  * go into **microG settings** and set up everything like:
     * check results in **Self-Check**, grant missing permissions (by tapping on them)
         * especially the **Battery Optimization** item
     * enable **Google device registration**
     * enable **Google Cloud Messaging** (only if you want to receive push messages from your applications)
     * enable **Google SafetyNet** (required for applications that utilize SafetyNet, for example Pokémon GO, ...)
         * '...' menu > set to use the **Official Server**
     * in **UnifiedNlp Settings** choose
         * **Mozilla Location Backend** as Geolocation backend
         * **Nominatim** as Address lockup backend
     * after everything is done, reboot
     * go to **Play Store**, setup account and install your apps

## Issues

List of known issues

* SafetyNet check fails with `Google Play Services not available`
  * you did not setup microG (or did not reboot afterwards)
* Play Store lacks fake signature spoofing permission
  * on ROMs like **crDroid** or **OmniROM**, that have built-in signature spoofing, in some cases the Play Store is not granted that permission automatically, to fix this either
     * issue the command `nanomod-overlay --permission` as root
     * go to Settings > Apps > Gear Icon > App Permissions > `Signature Spoofing` > Enable for Play Store
* Google Sync adapters lacking permissions
  * to fix this either
     * issue the command `nanomod-overlay --permission` as root
     * go to Settings > Apps > Google Contacts/Calendar Sync > Permissions > grant permissions
* Battery Drain
  * microG fails to register applications  to GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) if they were installed **before** microG, but the apps keep trying to register and that causes the battery drain, all apps installed **after** microG are properly registered, to fix the battery drain either
     * do a clean flash of your ROM (, Magisk) and NanoMod and install your apps after microG setup
     * uninstall and re-install all your applications (backup application data if required)
